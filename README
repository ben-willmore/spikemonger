= Getting spikemonger

Spikemonger is available from https://github.com/beniamino38/spikemonger .
You can get it using 'git' (a version control system) or by just downloading a
.zip/.tar.gz file ('Downloads' link).


= Machine

Spikemonger needs a beefy machine with lots of RAM (8GB) and lots of disk 
space (budget 3x the amount of space consumed by your raw data).


= Data files

Spikemonger works on .bwvt files (produced by BrainWare) or .f32 files 
(produced by BenWare). You will need to organise your data files into the 
structure expected by spikemonger:

<experiment_name>/<subdirectory>/raw.f32/<prefix>.N.f32

or

<experiment_name>/<subdirectory>/raw.bwvt/<prefix>.N.bwvt

where <experiment_name>, <subdirectory> and <prefix> can be whatever you like.

All files that should be clustered together should be in the same directory. 
Spikemonger will assume that consecutively numbered files are from 
neighbouring sites.

For example, for a bilateral recording, you want:

F1002/P02.whitenoise.L/raw.f32/P02.whitenoise.1.f32
F1002/P02.whitenoise.L/raw.f32/P02.whitenoise.2.f32
...
F1002/P02.whitenoise.R/raw.f32/P02.whitenoise.17.f32
F1002/P02.whitenoise.R/raw.f32/P02.whitenoise.18.f32
...
